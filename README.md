I created an image spotlight page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The functionality allows users to click on an image, which then dynamically moves to the top center of the screen, highlighting it as the focal point. This effect provides a seamless user experience by drawing attention to the selected image while maintaining an interactive and engaging design. The implementation relies on CSS transitions for smooth animations and JavaScript to handle the image selection and movement logic. The page is both visually appealing and responsive, ensuring it works across various devices and screen sizes.
